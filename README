A script to quicken the whole Django bootstrap process.

Usage:

    $ gig projectname


What it does:

* Picks what I think is a convenient directory structure.  This requries
  tweaking a few scripts but it keeps things organized.  Basically it breaks down to:

  configs/urls.py     # main urls.py
  configs/settings/   # settings!  Put your host-specific settings in `hostname`.py, eg if your host is
                      # foobar.example.com, the file would be foobar.py.  This is primarily to ease deployment
                      # and development across multiple hosts.  All base settings (eg, installed apps) go in 
                      # the base.py file, this should be imported by your host specific settings (one shoudl be
                      # generated for you, by the way)
  scripts/manage.py   # your standard manage.py script tweaked for this directory setup.
  vendor/             # Added to pythonpath, put any apps specific to this site here.
  media/              # MEDIA_ROOT points here by default in the base settings file.
  templates/          # Added to template dirs

* Adjusts settings so you can immediately run 'script/manage.py syncdb' and
  'script/manage.py runserver' to get rolling.  This basically just means it
  sets up a sqlite3 database by default.
* Enables admin app.  I use this 99% of the time so it's enabled by default.
* Provides probably-working WSGI and Apache configs.
* Provides a needs-some-tweaks fabfile.py
* Creates media/{css|img|js} and templates/ directories, because you're gonna
  need em so why not make them now?
