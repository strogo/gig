This script aims at providing a simple way to bootstrap a self-contained django project.

In short, it makes a few trivial decisions for you.

To those who use the Django framework this may seem a bit unecessary, but I believe that
it could be easier to get started with django, without having to impose minor decisions 
on new users such as where to place templates and basic media files.

    $ gig myproject
    
Will create:

    myproject/
        lib/
        lib/django/
        config/__init__.py
        config/urls.py
        config/settings/
        config/settings/__init__.py
        config/settings/base.py
        templates/
        media/
        script/
        script/manage
        

A bit about this layout.

    lib/
    
This is added to PYTHONPATH, so any new apps should go in here, as well as any existing 
django apps you might want to use

    config/

The project-wide config files (what `startproject` would typically generate, mostly).  Of
note are `urls.py` and...

    config/settings/
    
This is a module hoding `base.py`, used as the general config, and any host-specific configs.
For example, on my home machine I might have `config/settings/home.py` with paths specific to 
that setup, while at work I might have `config/settings/office.py`.  Or development and production
configs, of course.  Basically the same deal as Rails environments.

    templates/

App tempaltes.

    media/
    
App media (maybe, there is that whole deal of )

    script/manage
    
The usual manage.py created from `django-admin startproject`, but tweaked to deal with it's location.
