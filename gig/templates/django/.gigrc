description: A basic Django project buildout with a few nicities.
post_install_notes: Run syncdb and you should be good to go with an admin
    interface and an otherwise empty site.
    
    If you're content with a user/pass of admin/admin, run this:
    
    cd %(gig_project_home)s && \
        script/manage.py syncdb --noinput && \
        script/manage.py loaddata initial.json

    You should now be able to login to the admin with user admin and password admin
